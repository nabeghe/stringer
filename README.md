### Str Class

The main class that includes the useful methods is `Nabegh\String\Str`.

echo Str::random(32);
echo Str::random(32, '0123456789');
```

<hr>

### UnicodeControls Class

A class that includes some Unicode control characters;
for example, the invisible character, or the right-to-left and left-to-right markers.

```php
use Nabeghe\Stringer\UnicodeControls;

echo UnicodeControls::ISS; // Invisible
```

### Stringer Class

A string class.

Accepts any value, converts it to a string via strval, stores it, and returns it via __toString.

It is possible to access the methods of the `Str` class through the `Stringer` object as well, with the difference that the main text parameter is no longer present.

```php
use Nabeghe\Stringer\Stringer;

$string = new Stringer('In programming, a string is a sequence of characters, and string manipulation processes these characters.');
echo $string->after('string ')->before(','); // `is a sequence of characters`
```
